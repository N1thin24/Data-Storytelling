# NYC AirBnB Explorer
## Overview
Welcome to the NYC AirBnB Explorer, a visualization tool designed for travelers and data enthusiasts to explore Airbnb listings in New York City through an interactive and detailed dashboard. Our project aims to challenge the traditional Airbnb website by providing deeper insights and a more customized experience, helping travelers make informed decisions.

## Project Description
This project utilizes data from Airbnb to visualize accommodation options in NYC. Our dashboard comprises four interconnected views, each with detailed widgets that provide insights and allow users to uncover correlations between various data points such as price, location, and type of accommodation.

## Technical Achievements
 Data Source: Utilized a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that includes variables like accommodation type, location, description, and availability.
 Tools Used: Implemented using Plotly for dynamic visualizations and Streamlit for web deployment. Collaboration was managed through GitHub.
 Interactive Features: Includes hover information pop-ups, interconnected views that reflect changes dynamically, and multiple filtering options to tailor the visualization to user preferences.
